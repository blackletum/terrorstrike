the terror-strike concept belongs to both valve and turtle rock studios
left 4 dead belongs to valve

you may not, under ***ANY*** circumstances, sell, or distribute this mod with intent of monetary gain, because this mod is free.
you *can* however, mod the mod. Feel free to fork either mine or billy's branches, I'd reccomend his though since his is more up to date and has more bugfixes implemented.
Plus he's got the molotov I think mostly implemented.
You could probably mess with my fork when I end up figuring out pull requests, which might take me a few (thousand) ~~days~~ ~~years~~ millenia.

seriously though.
### ***DON'T SELL A FREE AND OPEN SOURCE PROJECT.***
### not even for a dollar.
