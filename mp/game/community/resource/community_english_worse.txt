"Cstrike_Tutor_Hint_1"		"Enemies can hear your footsteps when you run.\nHold in the Walk key (default Shift) to walk silently..."
"Cstrike_Tutor_Hint_2"		"Jumping slows your movement\nand decreases your accuracy."
"Cstrike_Tutor_Hint_3"		"Many objects in the world can be\nbroken, including some windows,\nboards, and boxes."
"Cstrike_Tutor_Hint_4"		"Working with your teammates makes\nyou much more effective than going it alone."
"Cstrike_Tutor_Hint_5"		"To get an overview of the current state\nof the game, hold down the TAB key."

// general weapon hints
"Cstrike_Tutor_Hint_10"		"Your weapon is not perfect - it recoils when you fire.\nTo fire more accurately use short bursts of gunfire,\npausing a moment to allow yourself to recover."
"Cstrike_Tutor_Hint_11"		"You are more accurate when you stand still,\nand even more so when you crouch."
"Cstrike_Tutor_Hint_12"		"Shooting an enemy in the head is\nan instant kill - a 'headshot'."
"Cstrike_Tutor_Hint_13"		"To be accurate with a sniper rifle, you\nmust stand still when you fire your shot."
"Cstrike_Tutor_Hint_14"		"Many weapons have 'secondary fire',\nproviding zoom, silencing, or burst fire\ndepending on the weapon.\n\nPress <right mouse button> for secondary fire."
"Cstrike_Tutor_Hint_15"		"Ammo management is extremely important -\nif your clip runs out in a firefight, you are in deep trouble.\n\nRemember to reload your weapon when you have a spare moment.\nHowever, reloading at the wrong time can get you killed.\n\nChoose wisely."

// specific weapon hints
"Cstrike_Tutor_Hint_20"		"The Magnum Sniper Rifle is very powerful and can usually\nkill an enemy with a single shot. Its extreme zoom\ncapability is very powerful, but firing this weapon\nwithout using the scope is nearly impossible.\n\nJust make sure no one gets close enough to be a problem."
"Cstrike_Tutor_Hint_21"		"The Schmidt Scout is a challenging sniper rifle.\nIt is inexpensive and does little damage -\n\nunless you are skilled enough to score a headshot..."
"Cstrike_Tutor_Hint_22"		"The Leone YG1265 Auto Shotgun is extremly powerful\nand very useful in close quarters.\n\nHowever, this weapon is all but useless at long range."
"Cstrike_Tutor_Hint_23"		"The Maverick M4A1 Carbine is a powerful and precise rifle.\n\nUsing secondary fire to attach a silencer makes\nthis the weapon of choice for the stealthy."
"Cstrike_Tutor_Hint_24"		"The CV-47 is as powerful as it is loud.\n\nAlthough it suffers from high recoil, accurate\nmarksmen prefer it for its lethal first shot."
"Cstrike_Tutor_Hint_25"		"The Night Hawk .50C is truly a 'hand cannon'.\n\nIts powerful ammunition stops enemies in their tracks.\n\nHowever, its clip is very small."
"Cstrike_Tutor_Hint_26"		"The Tactical Shield is a marvel of modern engineering.\n\nIf you deploy it (by pressing your secondary fire button)\nand crouch behind it, you are impervious to all damage\ncoming towards your front.\n\nHowever, your sides and rear are vulnerable,\nand HE Grenades can still harm you."

// equipment hints
"Cstrike_Tutor_Hint_30"		"A defusal Kit dramatically decreases the\namount of time it takes to defuse a bomb."
"CStrike_Tutor_Hint_31"		"To use a grenade, equip it (default 4) and then press\nthe Fire Button (default left mouse button).\n\nTo throw it, hold in your Fire Button, aim, and release.\n\nTo throw farther, tip your view upwards and run towards\nyour target when you release the grenade."
"CStrike_Tutor_Hint_32"		"'Flashbang' grenades temporarily blind everyone\nin the area who can see them when they explode.\n\nBe careful - this includes your teammates and even yourself!"
"Cstrike_Tutor_Hint_33"		"Turning your view away from a flashbang\ngrenade lessens its blinding effects."
"Cstrike_Tutor_Hint_34"		"Smoke grenades emit large clouds of dense\nsmoke that can hide player movements.\n\nSmoke can be very useful for slipping by a sniper."

// communication hints
"Cstrike_Tutor_Hint_40"		"Your radio allows you to give commands to your teammates\nsuch as 'Follow me', 'Hold this position', or 'Need backup'.\n\nTo send a radio command, use the radio keys\n(default Z, X, and C) and select what you want to say."

// radar hints
"Cstrike_Tutor_Hint_50"		"The green circle in the upper left corner is your radar.\n\nIt shows the positions of all of your surviving friends\nrelative to your current position and direction you are looking.\n\nIf a blip is at twelve o'clock, that friend is somewhere in front of you.\nLikewise, a blip at six o'clock is a friend behind you."
"Cstrike_Tutor_Hint_51" 	"On your radar, a blip shaped like a 'T' represents\na friend somewhere above you.\n\nAn upside-down 'T' blip is a friend somewhere below you."
"Cstrike_Tutor_Hint_52"		"If a friend is talking, his blip on\nthe radar will flash an orange color."
"Cstrike_Tutor_Hint_53"		"If you are a Counter-Terrorist, hostages\nwill appear on your radar as flashing blue blips."

// bomb scenario hints
"Cstrike_Tutor_Hint_60"		"Many bomb defusal maps have more than one bomb site..."
