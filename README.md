### Warning

Although this mod is based on SourcePlusPlus's CSS Port, some things will not work has expected.

### Bug

- The prop’s physics is a little... estranged... well sometimes you pass the entire prop but other times the prop push the player.
- The round DONT end don't import if the time is 0:00 just the round doesn’t end.
- The flashbang doesn’t disappear sometimes.
- The Animation system used in the leak is the same in the HL2MP it used the base_playeranimstate so this animsystem don’t come whit a MP support so you can see the player making the walk anim but stuck at the first frame.
  The only way to fix this is redo the animation system to make work whit multiplayer_animstates.
- The lighting in the classmenu for the models is bugged don’t used the color white it used estranged colors.
- The Dynamic crosshair it’s not the same to the he original CSS someone of the cvars don’t work.
- Using the Bots may cause the game crash.
